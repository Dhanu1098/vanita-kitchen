## Current Menu Structure

Your sidebar now has:
1. Dashboard
2. Orders
3. Customers
4. Subscriptions
5. Analytics
6. Email Reports
7. WhatsApp Entry
8. Menu Items
9. Settings
10. My Deliveries (separate section)

## Optional: Clean Your .env.local

If you want to remove the Gemini API key from your `.env.local`:

1. Open `c:\xampp\htdocs\dhanu\VK\.env.local`
2. Remove this line:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBw_MQrTpdey00NuQsxCWikNSQyH0nvGEQ
   ```
3. Save the file

(This is optional - keeping it won't cause any issues)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check your application** - AI Marketing should no longer appear in sidebar

3. **Everything else works normally** - all other features are intact

## What Remains Unchanged

✅ Dashboard
✅ Orders (with customer addresses working!)
✅ Customers
✅ Subscriptions
✅ Analytics
✅ Email Reports
✅ WhatsApp Entry
✅ Menu Items
✅ Settings
✅ My Deliveries (with navigation)

All done! 🎉
